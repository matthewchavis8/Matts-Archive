# Matt's Archive
Here is a description of my programming Journey. I started learning in January 2023 my senior year of high school.

# Start
So I began my journey with CS50 by Harvard, which is a great introductory course that I highly recommend. This course taught me strong fundamentals, and the instructor, David Milan, is an excellent professor.

# Courses
After completing CS50, I watched several tutorials to improve my basic understanding of the programming languages covered in the course.
I found the "Bro Code" courses particularly helpful. They are quick, provide in-depth explanations, and are taught by a cool instructor. 
The languages and tools I have learned in chronological order are as follows:
C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, React, and Next.js. 
The rest I gained through experience with NETCONF, YANG, Groovy, Tailwind, C#, Unity, TypeScript, Jira, and Confluence during my job and internship.

# How to Learn?
  Ok, I will not lie you can't just learn by watching tutorials. Tutorials are meant to be supplemental you need to be able to apply what you learned from tutorials. An example of this is when you were a child you were told how to do arithmetic right? Yes, you were, but I guarantee you that you did not get it immediately without being able to recall and apply it. Tutorials are the same way it will introduce and tell you how to use that tool or framework, but you need to apply it to truly understand it. But matt? How the hell do we apply programming how do we apply these tools? how do we apply? Well, this is where **Projects** come into play. **Projects** are a way for you to apply what you learned from tutorials I recommend doing one project or a couple of mini projects for each language. You can choose to do more if you want to go more in-depth.
- In a nutshell
  Learning goes **introduce/supplement** then **APPLY**. This is how we should approach learning.
  
# Do Not Forget to LeetCode on the side!
  A leetcode a day keeps the interviews away. Haha, so wtf is leetcode you might be wondering. Leetcode is a website used to practice technical data structures and algorithm questions. Now I will not go in-depth, but during interviews, you will have to solve these kinds of questions. Contrary to belief I would not bother watching a data structure and algorithm course, but I would instead just hop right in and learn as you go. However, I would watch a short video on time complexities and efficiency. But do not have to go in-depth just jump right in and do. Now it is gonna be hard as hell when you start and it will feel like you are not getting better. But trust me you will see yourself improve slowly but you will notice and you will take pleasure in it. Ok regarding strategies for learning how to leetcode everyone has different styles for it I am still experimenting. I am no expert by any means I only have 130 leetcode questions solved hope to crack 300 by December. Moreover, so my strategy is to set a timer and try to solve a question on your own. Just flounder for a set of time it teaches you how to problem solve. 
**Easy: 20 mins
Medium: 25 mins:
Hard: 30 mins:**
After the time is up you then can look at the solution and WATCH an explanation on YouTube. Also, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you or prompt it to ask what went wrong. Highly recommend you do this of course do not copy and paste heads up CHATGPT SUCKS IN REAL WORLD APPLICATION trust me I tried using it at work it does not work. Anyway, use ChatGPT or Ai as a tool if you want to take notes on something or ask you to explain use it like that!

# The Leetcode Catch 22/ The Leetcode conundrum
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d021f27a-61ea-4b7c-9694-8f5d50a15f7a)

So leetcode and tutorials/projects are all intertwined. It truly is one big catch-22 or conundrum you can say.
