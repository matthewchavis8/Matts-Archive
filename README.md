# 👨‍💻 Matt's Archive

Hey there! I started my programming journey in **January 2023**, during my senior year of high school. This README is my little archive — where I share the resources, strategies, and advice that helped me along the way.

## 🚀 Getting Started

I kicked things off with [**CS50**](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) by Harvard — an *excellent* intro course. Seriously, if you're just getting into programming, I can’t recommend it enough. David J. Malan? Dude’s a legend.

## 📚 Courses I Took

After CS50, I went through a bunch of tutorials to get more hands-on with the languages.  
I found **Bro Code** videos super helpful — fast, clear, and taught by a chill instructor.

### Languages & Tools I’ve Learned (in order):

**C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, React, Next.js**

From work and internships, I also picked up:  
**Groovy, Tailwind, C#, Unity, TypeScript, Jira, Confluence**

## 🛠️ How to Learn (For Real)

Let me be real with you: **you can't just watch tutorials and expect to learn**.  
They’re meant to *introduce* ideas, but the real magic happens when you **apply** them.

Think of it like when you learned math as a kid — you were *told* how to do it, but you didn’t actually *get it* until you practiced. Programming is the same.  

### So... how do you apply it?  
**Projects.**

Projects are where you *make* stuff and put your learning to the test.

### 🧠 My Past Projects
- Flight Simulator
- PNG Encoder
- Grep
- Cat
- Trading Algorithm  
- ASCII Ray Cast Engine  
- Personal Library App  
- Pomodoro App  
- eBay Web Scraper  
- Security Camera  
- Checkers Game  

In short:  
> **Learn → Apply**  
> Read the docs, skim a tutorial, and then jump into building something.

## 🧠 Don't Forget to LeetCode!

> *"A Leetcode a day keeps the interview away."*

So what is LeetCode? It’s a site to practice coding challenges and prepare for technical interviews. You *will* see these types of problems during interviews, no cap.

Do you need to take a whole DSA course first? Not really.  
My advice: **just jump in**. Maybe watch a quick video on time complexity, and go from there.

It’s gonna suck at first. It’ll feel like you’re not improving. But over time — trust me — you’ll look back and be shocked at how far you've come.

### My Strategy:
- Set a timer and **struggle first** (seriously, it builds problem-solving skills)
  - Easy: 20 mins  
  - Medium: 25 mins  
  - Hard: 30 mins  
- Then, look at the solution and **watch a YouTube explanation**
- Ask ChatGPT to explain your mistakes (don’t just copy/paste, though)

> Heads up: **ChatGPT kinda sucks for real-world code** — don’t rely on it at work. But it’s great for reviewing concepts and taking notes.

### 🔥 My Favorite YouTube Channels:
- [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode)  
- [Back To Back SWE](https://www.youtube.com/@BackToBackSWE)

## 💼 Getting an Internship

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0e1f22-dc21-4202-bcb8-b1aaa4f2dfbb)

At some point, you’re gonna want one. Whether it’s for:
- 💰 Money  
- 💼 Experience  
- 📄 Resume  
- 🏢 RTO  
...or all of the above — doesn’t matter to me. I’m just here to help.

This is all coming from a random 19-year-old who’s still figuring things out. But here's what worked for me:

---

## 📄 Crafting a Strong Resume

### With no experience? Here's the move:
**Structure it like this:**
> Education → Technical Skills → Experience → Projects

**Put Technical Skills at the top.**  
Why? Because recruiters spend *5 seconds* scanning resumes and a lot of them aren’t even in tech.

Your projects will carry the most weight early on. Before I landed any internships, my **Flight Simulator** project got me my first callback.

> 💡 Bonus tip: Join clubs (e.g. Robotics) or research labs — stack your resume that way.

Want an example? Feel free to use mine as a template:

## 📬 Applying

Okay, so your resume’s solid — now what?

**Spam apply.** I’m serious.

Use tools like [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/) to autofill apps and apply to *everything*.  
Your resume is a shotgun — send it out far and wide. One is bound to hit.

Don’t waste time tailoring each app early on. For your first internship, take *anything* that gives you experience. Once you land one, then you can get picky.

> I go to a no-name state school. I aimed for local companies first — more manageable competition.

## 🧘 Personal Advice

- Don’t compare yourself to others. Everyone has their own path so do not compare yourself with anyone else just your skills in the past. 
- Don’t be cocky. If you are arrogant no matter how smart you may think you are... you can and will miss out on some information due to how ignorant you are. Look do not be a Asshole or pretenious nobody likes those.  
- Don’t forget to live.

It’s easy to get stuck in the grind and miss out on the *college experience*. I’m not saying go crazy I’m saying find balance. The friendships, late-night talks, little moments they matter too.

I missed out on a few things in my first semester, both friendships and relationships I wish I had nurtured. That’s why I’m telling you:

> **Balance is everything.**
