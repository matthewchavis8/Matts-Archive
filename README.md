# Matt's Archive
I began my programming journey in January 2023, during my senior year of high school. This README outlines the resources and strategies I used to learn programming, along with advice.

# Start
I kicked things off with CS50 by Harvard, an excellent introductory course. I highly recommend it for building strong fundamentals. The instructor, David J. Malan, is fantastic!

# Courses
After completing CS50, I watched several tutorials to improve my basic understanding of the programming languages covered in the course.
I found the "Bro Code" courses particularly helpful. They are quick, provide in-depth explanations, and are taught by a cool instructor. 
The languages and tools I have learned in chronological order are as follows:
C, C++, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, React, and Next.js. 
The rest I gained through experience with NETCONF, YANG, Groovy, Tailwind, C#, Unity, TypeScript, Jira, and Confluence during my job and internship.

# How to Learn?
  Ok, I will not lie you can't just learn by watching tutorials. Tutorials are meant to be supplemental you need to be able to apply what you learned from tutorials. An example of this is when you were a child you were told how to do arithmetic right? Yes, you were, but I guarantee you that you did not get it immediately without being able to recall and apply it. Tutorials are the same way it will introduce and tell you how to use that tool or framework, but you need to apply it to truly understand it. But matt? How the hell do we apply programming how do we apply these tools? how do we apply? Well, this is where **Projects** come into play. **Projects** are a way for you to apply what you learned from tutorials I recommend doing one project or a couple of mini projects for each language. You can choose to do more if you want to go more in-depth.
  **My Past Projects**
  - **Flight Simulator**
  - **Trading Algorithm**
  - **ASCII Ray Cast Engine**
  - **Personal Library App**
  - **Pomodoro App**
  - **Ebay WebScraper**
  - **Security Camera**
  - **Chess Game**
- In a nutshell
  Learning goes **introduce/supplement** then **APPLY**. This is how we should approach learning. 
  
# Do Not Forget to LeetCode on the side!
  A leetcode a day keeps the interviews away. Haha, so wtf is leetcode you might be wondering. Leetcode is a website used to practice technical data structures and algorithm questions. Now I will not go in-depth, but during interviews, you will have to solve these kinds of questions. Contrary to belief I would not bother watching a data structure and algorithm course, but I would instead just hop right in and learn as you go. However, I would watch a short video on time complexities and efficiency. But do not have to go in-depth just jump right in and do. Now it is gonna be hard as hell when you start and it will feel like you are not getting better. But trust me you will see yourself improve slowly but you will notice and you will take pleasure in it. Ok regarding strategies for learning how to leetcode everyone has different styles for it I am still experimenting. I am no expert by any means I only have 130 leetcode questions solved hope to crack 300 by December. Moreover, so my strategy is to set a timer and try to solve a question on your own. Just flounder for a set of time it teaches you how to problem solve. 
**Easy: 20 mins
Medium: 25 mins:
Hard: 30 mins:**
After the time is up you then can look at the solution and WATCH an explanation on YouTube. Also, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the code to you or prompt it to ask what went wrong. Highly recommend you do this of course do not copy and paste heads up CHATGPT SUCKS IN REAL WORLD APPLICATION trust me I tried using it at work it does not work. Anyway, use ChatGPT or Ai as a tool if you want to take notes on something or ask you to explain use it like that!
**Best channels for explanations?**

# The Leetcode Catch 22/ The Leetcode conundrum
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d021f27a-61ea-4b7c-9694-8f5d50a15f7a)

So leetcode and tutorials/projects are all intertwined. It truly is one big catch-22 or conundrum you can say.

# Getting An Internship?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0e1f22-dc21-4202-bcb8-b1aaa4f2dfbb)

So at some point, you are going to want to land an internship whether it be **Money**, **Experience**, **Resume**, **RTO**, or everything above. It does not matter what your motivation is I do not care what you are in it for I am just here to help. Moreover, Take this with a grain of salt as this is coming from some random 19-year-old who barely got his feet wet in the industry. But here we go so the first step is to craft a strong resume. 
# Crafting a strong resume
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6047b59-7586-401d-b277-530f37b4180b)

Now how do we craft a strong resume with no experience (If you have great experience!)? Now with no experience landing the first one will be tough I will not lie to you, especially with the market today it will involve a lot of luck. Some might call me crazy, but I believe luck can be influenced. Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. So, how can we increase our "luck"? One way is by crafting a strong resume, which improves our chances of success when opportunities arise. Now crafting a strong resume I recommend you to structure it like this: Education->Technical Skills->Experience->Projects. Now for Experience, if you have no experience it is okay there are alternative ways. Another tip is to enhance your resume by adding relevant activities, like joining a club (e.g., "Robotics Club") or participating in a research lab to boost your profile. However, if you don’t have much experience, your projects will be the main focus of your resume. I’m being honest—your projects will be your biggest selling point. Feel free to use my resume as a template. It's worked well for me, and you can adapt it to create your own. The reason I say projects is that before I landed my internships my projects were what got me my callback. In fact, my flight simulator is the one that got me my first internship as that was the reason they interviewed me.

# Applying
Ok, so We have a strong resume I think we are ready to apply now. This one is pretty simple if you do not have previous experience SPAM apply hard. Just send out your application for everything. (https://simplify.jobs/) This extension auto fills some parts of the application trust me you will need it. The reason I say spam apply is because I believe if you have a strong resume and you shoot your resume out like a shotgun one pellet is bound to hit something. Also, the time spent tailoring your resume is just not worth it for your first internship. Landing the first one is tough and there is a saying "Beggars can't be choosers" For your first internship you just want to take whatever. Now after you land your first one you can start being picky because your call back will increase a lot. Currently after 2 internships, just for this cycle so far I have interviewed at Garmin, and Flow Traders(Quant), and as of right now, I am in the second round with a big bank on Wall Street which I can't spoil yet. Moreover, in my opinion, if you are in a no-name state school I would target internships near you what I mean is I would not bother targeting bigger places without a first internship due to the competition. But the easy way is to just look up software intern on Linked In and then just mass apply.
